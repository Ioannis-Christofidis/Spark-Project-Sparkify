# Spark-Project_Sparkify

## Packages

We use for this project a Jupyter Notebook with python 3. The libraries used for this project are:
1)numpy
2)pandas 
3)seaborn
4)pyspark
5)matplotlib

## Purpose of this project

 In this project, a Music streaming company wants to predict their customer/user churn rate (customers cancel confirmation events). I used Python and Spark for Big Data on the jupyter notebook.

## File  decription

There is a notebook and data folder. Notebook is developed to answer the questions of this project. We explored and prepared the data dropping the irrelevant values and replacing the missing values. We extract the necessary features from the smaller subset of data. We split the full dataset into train, test, and validation sets. Test out several of the machine learning methods. Evaluate the accuracy of the various models, tuning parameters as necessary.

## Results

We obseverve that the Random Forest works better than Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes and appears higher accuracy copared to other machine learning methods.

## Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Udacity for having access to the data through it.
